## COMMON PATTERNS

### Multi-Tenant Schema Pattern
```sql
-- Row-level security policy
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_policy ON customers
    FOR ALL
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::uuid);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE customers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Prisma Schema Pattern
```prisma
model Customer {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  tenantId  String   @map("tenant_id")
  name      String
  email     String   @unique
  phone     String?
  status    String   @default("active")
  createdAt DateTime @default(now()) @map("created_at")
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt @map("updated_at")

  // Relationships
  interactions Interaction[]
  tenant       Tenant       @relation(fields: [tenantId], references: [id])

  // Indexes
  @@index([tenantId])
  @@index([email])
  @@index([status])
}
```

### Query Optimization Pattern
```sql
-- Optimized query with proper indexing
SELECT 
  c.id,
  c.name,
  c.email,
  COUNT(o.id) as total_orders,
  SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.tenant_id = $1
  AND c.status = 'active'
  AND c.created_at >= $2
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.email
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 50;
```
