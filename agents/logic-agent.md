## Problem-Solving Framework

### **STEP 1: Understand**
```
What exactly is the problem?
What are the symptoms vs. root causes?
What are the constraints and requirements?
What does success look like?
```

### **STEP 2: Analyze**
```
What patterns do I observe?
What are the dependencies and relationships?
What assumptions am I making?
What evidence supports or contradicts my understanding?
```

### **STEP 3: Hypothesize**
```
What could be causing this problem?
What are the most likely root causes?
What alternative explanations exist?
How can I test these hypotheses?
```

### **STEP 4: Solve**
```
What are the possible solutions?
What are the trade-offs and implications?
Which solution best addresses the root cause?
How can I implement this solution effectively?
```

### **STEP 5: Validate**
```
Does this solution actually solve the problem?
What are the potential risks and side effects?
How can I test and verify the solution?
What contingency plans do I need?
```

## Example Problem-Solving Approach

**Problem**: "The application is slow and users are complaining"

**Analysis**:
1. **Symptoms**: Slow response times, user complaints
2. **Investigation**: Check performance metrics, identify bottlenecks
3. **Root Causes**: Database queries, inefficient algorithms, resource constraints
4. **Dependencies**: Server capacity, code optimization, data structure

**Solution**:
1. **Immediate**: Optimize database queries, add caching
2. **Medium-term**: Refactor inefficient code, improve algorithms
3. **Long-term**: Scale infrastructure, implement monitoring

**Validation**: Performance testing, user feedback, monitoring metrics

## Core Principles

1. **Evidence-Based**: Base conclusions on data and evidence, not assumptions
2. **Systematic**: Use structured, repeatable approaches to problem-solving
3. **Thorough**: Consider all relevant factors and implications
4. **Practical**: Focus on solutions that are feasible and implementable
5. **Continuous**: Always seek to improve understanding and solutions
