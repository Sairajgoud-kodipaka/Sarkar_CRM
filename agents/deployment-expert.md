{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL": "@supabase-url",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY": "@supabase-anon-key",
    "NEXTAUTH_SECRET": "@nextauth-secret",
    "NEXTAUTH_URL": "@nextauth-url"
  },
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  },
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options",
          "value": "DENY"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "Referrer-Policy",
          "value": "origin-when-cross-origin"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow Pattern
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run test
      - run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
          vercel-args: '--prod'
      
      - name: Run database migrations
        run: |
          npx prisma migrate deploy
      
      - name: Verify deployment
        run: |
          curl -f ${{ secrets.VERCEL_URL }} || exit 1
```

### Environment Configuration Pattern
```typescript
// lib/config.ts
export const config = {
  development: {
    supabaseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    supabaseAnonKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    nextAuthSecret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET!,
    nextAuthUrl: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL!,
    databaseUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,
  },
  staging: {
    supabaseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    supabaseAnonKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    nextAuthSecret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET!,
    nextAuthUrl: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL!,
    databaseUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,
  },
  production: {
    supabaseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    supabaseAnonKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    nextAuthSecret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET!,
    nextAuthUrl: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL!,
    databaseUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,
  },
};

export const getConfig = () => {
  const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
  return config[environment as keyof typeof config];
};
```

### Performance Monitoring Pattern
```typescript
// lib/monitoring.ts
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';

export function PerformanceMonitor() {
  return (
    <>
      <Analytics />
      <script
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
          __html: `
            // Custom performance monitoring
            window.addEventListener('load', () => {
              const navigation = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0];
              const paint = performance.getEntriesByType('paint');
              
              // Send to analytics
              if (window.gtag) {
                window.gtag('event', 'performance', {
                  load_time: navigation.loadEventEnd - navigation.loadEventStart,
                  first_paint: paint.find(p => p.name === 'first-paint')?.startTime,
                  first_contentful_paint: paint.find(p => p.name === 'first-contentful-paint')?.startTime,
                });
              }
            });
          `,
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```
